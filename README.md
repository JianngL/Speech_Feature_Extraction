# Speech Feature Extraction
Speech preprocessing for Machine Learning.

### Free speech datasets
* [OpenLSR](http://www.openslr.org): OpenSLR is a site devoted to hosting speech and language resources, such as training corpora for speech recognition, and software related to speech recognition.
* [VoxForge](http://www.voxforge.org/): VoxForge is now mirroring the LT and the Teleccoperation group Open Speech Data Corpus for German with 35 hours of speech from about 180 speakers. 
* TIMIT: The DARPA TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus.
* [Mozilla](https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/sharing-our-common-voice-mozilla-releases-second-largest-public-voice-data-set-e88f7d6b7666): Mozilla Releases the world's Second Largest Public Voice Data Set on Nov 29th, 2017.

### File description
* Codes are from [python_speech_features](https://github.com/jameslyons/python_speech_features). You can run "example.py" with Python3.
* [FeatureExtraction.ipynb](/FeatureExtraction.ipynb): Speech preprocessing, including loading data, pre-emphasis, framing, window, Fourier-transform, power spectrum, filter banks, mfccs and mean normalization.
